# Day - 1

## Time Complexity

### Important Points

- <u>***Definition***</u> - Time Complexity is the relationship about how the time will grow as the input grows.
- Time Complexity != Total Time Taken by a Machine to execute.
- There are mainly 4 points for Time Complexity:
  1. Always look for the **Worst Case Time Complexity**.
  2. Always look at the **Complexity for Large Data**.
  3. Always **Ignore Constants**.
  4. Always **Ignore Less Dominant Terms**. *From Point 2*

## Akra-Bazzi Time Complexity Method

If the recurrence become more complex then finding the time complexity will become harder. So, Akra-Bazzi method is the easy and simple method to find the Time Complexity.

The method goes as follows:

Let $p$ be the unique real number for which 
$$\sum_{i=1}^{k} a_ib_i^p = 1$$

Then,

$$T(x) = \Theta\biggl(x^p + x^p \int_1^x \frac{g(u)}{u^{p+1}} du\biggl)$$

## Asymptotic Notation

The usage of Asymptotic Notation is for specifying and for the identification of the upper and lower bounds.

$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)}$$

Below are the Asymptotic Notations:

### Big - $O$ Notation ($\leq$  Upper Bound)

This is the Upper Bound and the complexity cannot go beyond this Upper Bound.

$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} < \infty$$

### Big - $\Omega$ Notation ($\geq$  Lower Bound)

This is the opposite of Big - $O$ Notation. This is the Lower Bound and the function complexity will atleast require Lower Bound complexity.

$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} > 0$$

### Big - $\Theta$ Notation (Average)

The Big - $\Theta$ Notation was created when a function lies in both Upper Bound (Big - $O$) and Lower Bound (Big - $\Omega$).

$$0 < \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} < \infty$$

### Little - $o$ Notation ($<$ Upper Bound)

The Little - $o$ is same as Big - $O$ but it is slightly loose and strictly lesser than.

$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0$$

### Little - $\omega$ Notation ($>$  Lower Bound)

The Little - $\omega$ is same as Big - $\Omega$ but it is slightly loose and strictly greater than.

$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \infty$$

## Space Complexity

- Space Complexity is measured by combining the Input Space and the Auxilary Space. The same Asymptotic Notations discussed above are the ones used for Space Complexity.

# Day - 2

## Recursion

### Important Points

- Recursion helps in solving bigger/complex problems into smaller problems which can be solved in a simple way.
- You can convert a Recursion solution into Iterative and Vice Versa.
- Space Complexity is not constant due to Recursive Calls.

### Types of Recurrence Relations

1. Linear Recurrence Relation
2. Divide & Conquer Recurrence Relation

### How to understand & approach a problem?

- Identify if you can break down problem into smaller problems.
- Write the Recurrence Relations if needed.
- Draw the Recursive Tree.
- About the Tree:
  - See the flow of functions, how they are getting into the stack.
  - Identify and Focus on Left Tree Calls and Right Tree Calls.
  - Draw the tree and pointers using Pen & Paper for better understanding. *
  - Use a debugger to see the flow.
- See how the values and what type of values are returned at each step. See where the function will come out. In the end you will come out of the main function.
- Three Variables to concentrate on:
  - Arguments
  - Return Type
  - Body of Function
