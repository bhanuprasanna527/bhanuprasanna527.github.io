## Hi there üëã, Let's Start üßë‚Äçüíª

### Short Intro üëå

- My Name is Bhanu Prasanna, Started M.Sc. Data Science at TU Dortmund.
<!-- - Want to become a <u>***Quant Developer***</u> -->

That is all there is to know about me. <u>***Let's Start with the challenge***</u>.

## 90 Days DSA Challenge

Why am I doing this? I have created a python library, learnt how to use Tensorflow and other ML Libraries. There was always a missing piece needed to be filled.

The missing piece is <u>***DSA***</u>.

## Shall we Start Now Already? ü§®

From 26th October, 2023 the challenge will officially start.

- Notes Available. <a href="https://bhanuprasanna527.github.io/notes/2023-10-25-C++/" target="blank">Click Here!</a>

Let's go <u>***Step-by-Step***</u>.

1. [Choosing the Programming Language](/challenges/2023-10-25-90_DSA_Challenge/#i.-choosing-the-programming-language)
<!-- 2. -->

### I. Choosing the Programming Language

As I want to become a Quant Developer. The most used programming language is <u>**C++**</u>.

- **Note:** Most firms in the world use the latest C++ version. The current version of C++ is 20 as of the time of this challenge.

The resources that I used for Learning C++ are provided below:

1. YouTube - [Time and Space Complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV3wrLBbuuE&pp=ygUadGltZSBhbmQgc3BhY2UgY29tcGxleGl0eSA%3D) - ‚úÖ 26-10-2023
2. YouTube - [Introduction to Recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2uO2nMT0Bk&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=24) - ‚úÖ 27-10-2023
3. YouTube - [Maths for DSA - 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzip9Aml6og&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=26) - ‚úÖ 27-10-2023
4. YouTube - [Math for DSA - 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmSpZ0bjCyQ&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=27) - ‚úÖ 27-10-2023


## Day 1 - Time and Space Complexity

For Day 1 - I don't want to start coding but instead understand the more theoretical parts.

I have completed <u>***Time and Space Complexity***</u> from the YouTube Video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV3wrLBbuuE&pp=ygUadGltZSBhbmQgc3BhY2UgY29tcGxleGl0eSA%3D" target="blank">Click Here!</a>.


## Day 2 - Recursion and Math for DSA

For Day 2 - I will be going through Recursion concept and Math for DSA.

I have completed <u>***Recursion***</u> from the YouTube Video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2uO2nMT0Bk&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=23" target="blank">Click Here!</a>.

I have completed <u>***Math for DSA - 1***</u> from the YouTube Video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzip9Aml6og&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=25" target="blank">Click Here!</a>.

I have completed <u>***Math for DSA - 2***</u> from the YouTube Video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmSpZ0bjCyQ&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=27" target="blank">Click Here!</a>.

## Day 3 - C++ Start ‚ùÑÔ∏è

For Day 3 - I am going to start C++ learning from start. I have a foundation but need to improve this a lot.

I have completed 5 hours <u>***C++***</u> from this YouTube Video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpfHmAkRVK4&list=LL&index=9" target="blank">Click Here!</a>.

I have solved 18 problems in C++ Hackerrank. - [Click Here!](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/bhanuprasanna81).

## Day 4 - C++ Book

For Day 4 - I am going to solve more problems in Hackerrank and read the Sams C++ book.

I have solved total of 28 Hackerrank Problems in the C++ section. <u>***I feel confident in C++.***</u> - [Click Here!](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/bhanuprasanna81).

Read 2 Lessons form Sams C++ Book.

## Day 5 - C++ Problems

For Day 5 - I am going to start solving LeetCode while simultaneously start learning DSA.

I have solved 5 LeetCode problems in the Array Section. - [Click Here!](https://leetcode.com/bhanuprasanna527/).

## Day 6 - C++ Problems

For Day 6 - I am going to solve more problems in LeetCode and read a Lesson from Sams C++ Book.

I have completed solving 5 LeetCode Problems in the Array Section. - [Click Here!](https://leetcode.com/bhanuprasanna527/).

I have completed reading Lesson 4 from Sams C++ Book.

## Day 7 - Data Structures in C++

For Day 7 - I am going to start Data Structures. In DS, I will be starting with Linked List types and it's operations.

I have completed Single Linked List, Double Linked List, and Circular Linked List.

Implemented Operations for Variants of Linked List's are:

1. Insert Front
2. Insert Back
3. Insert Middle
4. Delete Front
5. Delete Back
6. Delete Middle
7. Length
8. Print Linked List
