## Hi there 👋, Let's Start 🧑‍💻

### Short Intro 👌

- My Name is Bhanu Prasanna, Started M.Sc. Data Science at TU Dortmund.
- Want to become a <u>***Quant Developer***</u>

That is all there is to know about me. <u>***Let's Start with the challenge***</u>.

## 90 Days DSA Challenge

Why am I doing this? I have created a python library, learnt how to use Tensorflow and other ML Libraries. There was always a missing piece needed to be filled.

The missing piece is <u>***DSA***</u>.

## Shall we Start Now Already? 🤨

From 26th October, 2023 the challenge will officially start.

Let's go <u>***Step-by-Step***</u>.

1. [Choosing the Programming Language](/challenges/2023-10-25-90_DSA_Challenge/#i.-choosing-the-programming-language)
<!-- 2. -->

### I. Choosing the Programming Language

As I want to become a Quant Developer. The most used programming language is <u>**C++**</u>.

- **Note:** Most firms in the world use the latest C++ version. The current version of C++ is 20 as of the time of this challenge.

The resources that I used for Learning C++ are provided below:

1. YouTube - [C++ 20 - FreeCodeCamp Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLOx1hD3_o&pp=ygUKYysrIGNvdXJzZQ%3D%3D)
2. YouTube - [Time and Space Complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV3wrLBbuuE&pp=ygUadGltZSBhbmQgc3BhY2UgY29tcGxleGl0eSA%3D)
2. Hackerrank -

## Day 1 - Time and Space Complexity

For Day 1 - I don't want to start coding but instead understand the more theoretical parts.

I have started with <u>***Time and Space Complexity***</u> from the YouTube Video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV3wrLBbuuE&pp=ygUadGltZSBhbmQgc3BhY2UgY29tcGxleGl0eSA%3D" target="blank">Click Here!</a>.
