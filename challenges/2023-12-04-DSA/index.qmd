## Hi there 👋, Let's Start 🧑‍💻

### Short Intro 👌

- My Name is Bhanu Prasanna, Started M.Sc. Data Science at TU Dortmund.
<!-- - Want to become a <u>***Quant Developer***</u> -->

That is all there is to know about me. <u>***Let's Start with the challenge***</u>.

## DSA Challenge

Why am I doing this? I have created a python library, learnt how to use Tensorflow and other ML Libraries. There was always a missing piece needed to be filled.

The missing piece is <u>***DSA***</u>.

## Shall we Start Now Already? 🤨

From 4th December, 2023 the DSA will officially start.
